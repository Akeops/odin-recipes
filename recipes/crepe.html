        <p>This page will learn to you how to cook an excellent crêpes.</p>

        <h3>Recipes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>140g plain flour</li>
            <li>200ml whole milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>25g unsalted butter, melted, plus a little extra for greasing</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>step 1</strong>
        <p>Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a medium-size bowl and make a well in the middle. Mix the milk and 100ml of water together. Break the eggs into the well and start whisking slowly. Add the milk and water in a steady stream, whisking constantly and gradually incorporating the flour as you do so.</p>

        <strong>step 2</strong>
        <p>Whisk until the batter is smooth and all the flour has been incorporated. Set the batter aside to rest for 30 mins, then whisk the melted butter into the batter.</p>

        <strong>step 3</strong>

        <p>Heat the pan over a medium heat. Very lightly grease the pan with melted butter. Using a ladle, pour roughly 2 tbsp of batter into the pan and swirl it around so the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. You want to use just enough batter to make a delicate, lacy pancake. Cook the pancake for about 45 secs on one side until golden and then using a palette knife or fish slice, flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 30 secs until it freckles.</p>

        <strong>step 4</strong>

        <p>Slide the pancake out of the pan and either serve immediately or stack on a plate with baking parchment in between. Continue until all the batter is used up.</p>
